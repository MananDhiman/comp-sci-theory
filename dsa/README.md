# Data structures
## What is Data Structure?
Data Structure is different ways of organising data on computer so that it can be stored, accessed, modified efficiently and quickly
## What is an algorithm?
Set of steps to complete a task. Choose steps (algo) such that tasks is completed quickly and efficiently
### Criteria for algo?
- Correctness
- Efficiency

## Types of DS:

### Linear
- Static
- Array
- Dynamic
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue

### Non Linear
- Tree
- Graph

## Types of Algo:
- Searching
- Sorting
- Simple Recursive
- Backtracking
- Divide and Conquer
  - Divide problem into smaller problems of same type, and solve these
  - Combine the solutions of subproblems into a solution of the original problem
  - Must contain atleast two recursive calls
  - Example: Quicksort, merge sort 
- Dynamic Programming
  - Works based on memoization (remembers past results and uses them to find new result)
  - To find best solution among multiple possible solutions
- Greedy
  - Also to find best possible solution
  - Works in phases, we take the best we can without worrying about future (choose local optimum at each step and hopefully end up at global optimum)
- Brute Force
  - Tries all possibilities until solution found
