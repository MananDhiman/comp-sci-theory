Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides machines the capability to learn automatically and improve fromexperience without being explicitly programmed.

In simple words, it helps machines to solve a given problem by gaining the ability to think.

Algorithm

Algorithm is a set of rules and statistical techniques used to learn and derive insights from data patterns. e.g., Decision tree, Linear Regression, and Random Forest.



Supervised Learning - A technique that uses labeled data for training the model.

Unsupervised Learning - A technique that uses unlabeled data for training the model.

Reinforcement learning - A part of Machine Learning where an agent is put in an environment where he learns to behave by performing actions that will either be rewarded or punished.
